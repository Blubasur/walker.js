## ü§ì Usage

You can implement all sorts of front-end user events from e-commerce actions like product add to carts, product usage events, and UX events like visible elements, scrolling, etc. using the walker.

By setting just a few HTML attributes, you'll for example get something like this:

```js
dataLayer.push({
  event: 'product add',
  entity: 'product',
  action: 'add',
  data: {
    name: 'Everyday Ruck Snack',
    price: 220,
  },
  trigger: 'click',
  nested: [],
  elbwalker: true,
});
```

All you need to get started are the entity, action & trigger attributes.

```html
<!-- General usage -->
<div elb="ENTITY" elb-ENTITY="KEY:VALUE" elb-action="TRIGGER:ACTION" />
```

You define the entity scope by setting the `elb` attribute with the name of an entity to an element, e.g. `elb="product"`.
An action can be added by setting the `elb-action` attribute on the same level or all child elements in combination with a matching trigger, e.g. `elb-action="click:add"` to fire a <strong> product add </strong> event when a user clicks on the tagged element.
To define the entities' properties, set the composited attribute `elb-ENTITY` with the name and value, e.g. `elb-product="name:Everyday Ruck Snack;price:220"`.

```html
<div elb="product" elb-product="name:Everyday Ruck Snack;price:220">
  <button elb-action="click:add">Add to cart</button>
</div>
```

### Triggers

By using the walker.js you don't have to deal with event listener or mutation observer initialization anymore. The walker comes with a bunch of integrated triggers that will fire your event at the right moment.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Trigger</th>
    <th>Definiton</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>load</td>
    <td>after loading a page when DOM is ready</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>click</td>
    <td>when the element or a child is clicked</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>visible</td>
    <td>after the element has been in viewport for at least 50% for one second</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>submit</td>
    <td>on a valid form submission</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>custom</td>
    <td>calling elbLayer.push()</td>
  </tr>
</table>
